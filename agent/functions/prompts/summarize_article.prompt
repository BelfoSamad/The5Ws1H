Summarize the content of the provided article into the schema provided below. Follow these specific guidelines:

- Is it an article?: If the content is not an article but instead seems to be random webpage content (e.g., a product page, blog post, or advertisement), respond with: 'Error: The provided content is not a news article.'
- All answers should be string. If multiple answers are available, split them by comma.
- Concise Answers: Keep each answer focused strictly on its respective question. For example, for "Who" simply list the involved parties without adding context like their role or location.
- Handling Missing Information: If the article does not provide sufficient information to answer a specific question, leave that answer blank.
